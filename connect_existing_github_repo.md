# Connect to Existing GitHub Repository: TradeCoverEngine

## Current Issue
Git operations are blocked in this environment due to system restrictions. Here are alternative solutions to get your automatic deployment working.

## Solution 1: GitHub Actions Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

Your deployment package already includes GitHub Actions workflows. Once uploaded to your repository, they will automatically:
- Test your code on every push
- Deploy to Heroku automatically
- Handle environment variables and secrets

## Solution 2: Direct Heroku CLI Connection

If you have Heroku CLI installed locally, you can connect directly:

```bash
# Connect to your Heroku app
heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name

# Deploy directly
git push heroku main
```

## Solution 3: Heroku GitHub Integration

1. Go to your Heroku app dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Deploy" tab
3. Connect to GitHub and select: `NVMtheName/TradeCoverEngine`
4. Enable "Automatic deploys" from the main branch
5. Every push to GitHub will automatically deploy

## What You Need to Upload

The `arbion_deployment_20250602_151004.zip` contains everything needed:
- Complete Arbion trading platform
- GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
- Heroku configuration files
- Production-ready settings

## Required Heroku Config Vars

For full functionality, set these in your Heroku app:
- `FLASK_ENV`: production
- `SESSION_SECRET`: (random 32-character string)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: (your OpenAI API key)
- `SCHWAB_API_KEY`: (your Schwab client ID)  
- `SCHWAB_API_SECRET`: (your Schwab client secret)

Once you upload the files to your GitHub repository and connect it to Heroku, automatic deployment will be restored.
