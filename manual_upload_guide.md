# Manual Upload Guide for TradeCoverEngine Repository

## Repository: https://github.com/NVMtheName/TradeCoverEngine

Since Git operations aren't working in this environment, here's how to manually upload your Arbion platform files:

## Option 1: Download and Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. **Download the deployment package**: `arbion_deployment_20250602_151004.zip`
2. **Extract the ZIP file** on your local machine
3. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/NVMtheName/TradeCoverEngine
4. **Upload files**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or drag and drop
   - Upload all extracted files maintaining the folder structure
   - Commit changes with message: "Deploy Arbion trading platform"

## Option 2: Local Git Commands

If you have the repository cloned locally:

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd path/to/TradeCoverEngine

# Extract the deployment package contents here
# Then commit and push:
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Arbion trading platform with Heroku integration"
git push origin main
```

## Essential Files to Upload

Make sure these key files are uploaded:
- `app.py` - Main application
- `Procfile` - Heroku configuration  
- `app.json` - Deployment metadata
- `runtime.txt` - Python version
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `.github/workflows/` - Deployment automation

Your platform will be ready for production deployment with automatic testing and monitoring.
